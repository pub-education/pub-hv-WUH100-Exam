                    <p>Much of what I write is from experience and even though I of course learned it from various
                        sources it was a long time ago and impossible to remember where it all came from. However,
                        things that I look up and take from books during the process now I will provide references
                        to.

                        <h2>HTML layout</h2>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using the provided modeled layout we have three sections a header, main, and footer. So,
                            we
                            start with entering those using the new semantic elements from HTML5 header, main, and
                            footer,
                            wrapped in two div elements with classes page-wrapper and content-wrapper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will be using HTML5 because it's a standard which support is almost universal even in
                            many older browsers, as is evident from <a
                                href="https://caniuse.com/?search=html5">caniuse.com</a> <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.
                            The
                            idea of using other designs than &quot;1.&quot; for ordered list items was taken from an
                            answer in <a
                                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22530982/html-numbering-with-brackets"
                                target="_self">stackoverflow.com</a> <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
                            The
                            pages are also saved as .html files as opposed to .xhtml which means they will not be
                            parsed
                            by the XML parser but the DOM will be created by the HTML parser.

                            I have chosen to use the IEEE reference system as described in the <a
                                href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Reference-Guide-Online-v.04-20-2021.pdf">IEEE

                        <h3>Header</h3>
                        <p>
                            The header section can be divided into two main parts, logo and navigation. We separate
                            those by
                            putting them into a div and a nav element respectively so we can position them easier
                            later
                            on.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Main Section</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main section where all content will go can be seen as divided into two main areas.
                            An
                            upper
                            helo image with an overlayed text section and the main content section containing no
                            less
                            than
                            three columns since you wanted the middle to move to the top for smaller screens. So, we
                            section
                            this off with two div elements to start with and then we add three section elements to
                            the
                            lower
                            div to use for the three columns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each of the section elements contains an image and a few paragraphs of text. We section
                            these off with two div elements and put an image element in the top one and three p
                            elements
                            in the lower.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Footer</h3>
                        <p>
                            The footer is divided into three columns each containing a head and text. We section it
                            off
                            with
                            three div elements and put a h3 element and an ul section in each to make the text align
                            nicely when we make it into a list.
                        </p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>
                            With this we are done with the initial markup of the home page and the header and
                            footer.
                            Header and footer
                            will be copied to subsequent pages so that we will have consistency in the feel and look
                            of
                            the site. We cannot use JavaScript to change content as needed nor server-side code to
                            assemble pages on request in this particular assignment. We might tweak it later
                            on if we need to in order to make it behave and look the way we
                            want.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>The Stylesheet Development Process</h2>
                        <h3>Main setup</h3>
                        <p>
                            I tend to try to write my stylesheets in separate files that each belongs to a specific
                            section or component of the webpage/site. E.g. page, navigation, footer and main
                            content.
                            Hence, the main style sheet is called styles.css where I link in the other stylesheets
                            in
                            order. It also links in a reset stylesheet that removes and resets all padding, margins,
                            borders, etc and makes sure that we are using box-sizing border-box instead of the
                            default
                            content-box. Why? Because it's much easier to calculate the sizes of elements when
                            content,
                            padding, and borders are included in the size and we only have to accommodate for
                            margins.
                            Important to remember is that we first import the reset stylesheet, otherwise we will
                            have
                            problems since the styles are applied in the order they appear.
                            However, since the requirement here is to contain all styling in one document I will
                            instead
                            section off that document into sections for header, main content, and footer.
                            The styling for the Analysis page will however be in a separate document as will the
                            fonts.
                            I've tried to find the source of my reset.css but I can't find it.I've had the file a
                            long
                            time and can't remember where or when I got it, hence no reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We use css variables for the colors we want to use which makes it easier to change later
                            on
                            if we need to.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Header Section</h3>
                        <p>
                            Starting with sizing the logo image to 200px. We define the size in the stylesheet even
                            though the width is set to &quot;200&quot; in the img tag, we do that so that the much
                            larger image used will not disturb and create some unwanted visual effects
                            during rendering.
                            Then we make the containing header element a flexbox and chose space-between for the
                            justify-content directive to put logo and navigation at each end of the box.
                            Then we remvove the bullets in front of each item and set the li elements inline. Then we
                            set
                            their hovering response, using transition for a smoother response. To use more than one
                            property in transitions see <a
                                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7048313/how-to-have-multiple-css-transitions-on-an-element">StackOverflow.com</a>
                            <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>. We have a link to each of the two pages and two dummy links linked
                            to the home/index page.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Main Content Section</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next up is the main / content section. We start with the
                            helo image and and put that in a new div element. Then we put the p element inside a new
                            divs so that we can place it and give the p element a
                            faded background for the text, making it stick out a little better over the image.
                            Then it's time for the three little content cards with their images. They are already in
                            separate section tags that we use here instead of div tags since HTML5 has made these
                            new
                            semantic elements available to us. First, we will make the containing div element a
                            flexbox
                            so we can place the different sections as we wish. <span class="text-comment">Could just
                                as
                                well have done this with
                                grids. I might do another version later using grids instead of flexbox just for
                                fun.</span> Flexbox is by default set to row so no real need for using
                            flex-direction
                            here <a href="#ref-5">[5]</a>.
                            The cards section themselves are divide into two sections, card-image and card-text, with
                            div elements. We create the rounded effect of the image part with a border-radius set to 50%
                            and we make the card-image container square with a little trick using clamp() <a
                                href="#ref-6">[6]</a>. Clamp has a decent support amongst most modern browsers from mid
                            2020 and onwards <a href="#ref-7">[7]</a>. For this purpose I will be happy with that, for a
                            wider audience in a production environment we would have had to include JavaScript support
                            to accomplish the same objective. Here we make sure that the image rezises relative to the
                            vierwport when the viewport gets smaller than 960px wide. It's set to 60% of the size of one
                            third of the viewport width.
                            To accomplish the overlay effect with the rounded image(s) sticking up over the helo image
                            we use a negative margin-bottom value in the main-helo class of which will make the
                            main-content
                            class elements render above the helo image. OK we had to set their z-index too to layer
                            them. Then we also but a border around the image using the same
                            color as the background to get that upper frame effect even though it goes around the whole
                            image.
                        </p>
