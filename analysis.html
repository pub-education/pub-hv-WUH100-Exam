                    <h1>Process analysis</h1>
                    <p>Much of what I write is from experience and even though I of course learned it from various
                        sources it was a long time ago and impossible to remember where it all came from. However,
                        things that I look up and take from books during the process now I will provide references to.

                        <h2>HTML layout</h2>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using the provided modeled layout we have three sections a header, main, and footer. So, we
                            start with entering those using the new elements from HTML5 header, main, and footer,
                            wrapped in two div elements with classes page-wrapper and content-wrapper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As we will only use elements that has been around for a long time and some of the new
                            sematic elements we find that support is almost universal even in many older browsers, as is
                            evident from <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=html5">caniuse.com</a> <a
                                href="#ref-1">[1]</a>, we therefore
                            chose to
                            use HTML5 . The idea of using other designs than 1. for ordered list items was taken from an
                            answer in <a
                                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22530982/html-numbering-with-brackets"
                                target="_self">stackoverflow.com</a> <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>
                            The
                            pages are also saved as .html files as opposed to .xhtml which means they will not be parsed
                            by the XML parser but the DOM will be created by the less stringent HTML parser.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have chosen to use the IEEE reference system as described in the <a
                                href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Reference-Guide-Online-v.04-20-2021.pdf">IEEE
                                Reference Guide</a> <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Header</h3>
                        <p>
                            The header section can be divided into two main parts, logo and navigation. We separate
                            those by
                            putting them into a div and a nav element respectively so we can position them easier later
                            on.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Main Section</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main section where all content will go can be seen as divided into two main areas. An
                            upper
                            helo image with an overlayed text section and the main content section containing no less
                            than
                            three columns since you wanted the middle to move to the top for smaller screens. So, we
                            section
                            this off with two div elements to start with and then we add three section elements to the
                            lower
                            div to use for the three columns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each of the section elements contains an image and a few paragraphs of text. We section
                            these off with two div elements and put an image element in the top one and three p elements
                            in the lower.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Footer</h3>
                        <p>
                            The footer is divided into three columns each containing a head and text. We section it off
                            with
                            three div elements and put a h3 element and an ul section in each to make the text align
                            nicely when we make it into a list.
                        </p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>
                            With this we are done with the initial markup of the home page and the header and footer.
                            Header and footer
                            will be copied to subsequent pages so that we will have consistency in the feel and look of
                            the site. We cannot use JavaScript to change content as needed nor server-side code to
                            assemble pages on request in this particular assignment. We might tweak it later
                            on if we need to in order to make it behave and look the way we
                            want.

                        <h2>The Stylesheet Development Process</h2>
                        <h3>Main setup</h3>
                        <p>
                            I tend to try to write my stylesheets in separate files that each belongs to a specific
                            section or component of the webpage/site. E.g. page, navigation, footer and main content.
                            Hence, the main style sheet is called styles.css where I link in the other stylesheets in
                            order. It also links in a reset stylesheet that removes and resets all padding, margins,
                            borders, etc and makes sure that we are using box-sizing border-box instead of the default
                            content-box. Why? Because it's much easier to calculate the sizes of elements when content,
                            padding, and borders are included in the size and we only have to accommodate for margins.
                            Important to remember is that we first import the reset stylesheet, otherwise we will have
                            problems since the styles are applied in the order they appear. :)
                            However, since the requirement here is to contain all styling in one document I will instead
                            section off that document into sections for header, main content, and footer.
                            The styling for the Analysis page will however be in a separate document as will the fonts.
                            I've tried to find the source of my reset.css but I can't find it.I've had the file a long
                            time and can't remember where or when I got it, hence no reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We use css variables for the colors we want to use which makes it easier to change later on
                            if we need to.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Header Section</h3>
                        <p>
                            Starting with sizing the logo image to 200px.
                            Then we make the containing header element a flexbox and chose space-between for the
                            justify-content directive so we put logo and navigation at each end of the box.
                            Then remvove the bullets in front of each item and set the li elements inline. Then we set
                            their hovering response. To use more than one property in transitions see <a
                                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7048313/how-to-have-multiple-css-transitions-on-an-element">StackOverflow.com</a>
                            <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up is the main / content section We start with the helo image and and put that in a new
                            div element. Then we put the p element inside two new divs so that we can place it and get a
                            faded background for the text making it stick ou a little better over the image.
                            Then it time for the three little content cards with their images. They are already in
                            separate sections tags that we use here instead of div tags since HTML5 has made these new
                            semantic elements available to us. First, we will make the containing div element a flexbox
                            so we can place the different sections as we wish. Could just as well have done this with
                            grids. I might do another version later using grids instead of flexbox just for fun.
